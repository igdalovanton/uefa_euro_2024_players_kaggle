# Exploring Kaggle dataset uefa_euro_2024_players

Initially, the idea was to calculate 5 of the most common names in the UEFA EURO 2024 and investigate further. But I got stuck on the first step. The same name has many variations, like "Alex" and "Alexander." I did my best to provide the top 5 names with better accuracy than counting them "as is."
